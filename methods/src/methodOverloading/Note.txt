Method overloading
===================

1) in a class having multiple method with the same name,but difference in arguments is called as method overloading


in order to achieve method overloading we need to satisfy either 1 of the following 3 rules.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)ther should be a change in the no of arguments.
2)there should be a change in the datatype of the arguments.
3)there should be a change in the order/sequence of the datatypes.

NOTE:
=====
1)Both static and Non-Static methods can be Overload.
2)Yes, we can Overload main() as well,but the Execution starts from the main() which accepts String[] as the arguments.
3)Return type might be same or different.
4)Method overloading is also referred as compile time Polymorphism.
