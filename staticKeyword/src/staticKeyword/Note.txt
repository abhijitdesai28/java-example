static
======

1)static is a keyword which can be used with class,variable,method,and blocks.

2)the class loader loads all the static properties inside a memory location called as class area / static pool.

3)all the static properties has to accessed with help of classname.

4)static properties can be accessed directly or with help of classname in the same class.

5)static properties can be accessed only with the help of classname in the different / another class.
                syntax---classname.variablename   or  classname.methodname()



NOTE
=====
1)static properties are loaded only once,  therefore they will have a single copy.

2)all objects will implicitly be pointing to the static pool,therefore we can access static properties with object referance but
     not a good practice.
